# Hype Video Plan

## Goal
Create a 60–75 second “intelligent data workspace” hype video that showcases how quickly users can construct tables, collaborate with AI, run research, fine-tune schema, and generate new tables directly from imported files. The edit should feel energetic (fast hook, kinetic text, confident soundtrack) while keeping the UI footage front and center.

## Reference Inspiration
- **Linear – “Build without meetings”**: minimalist UI hero shots, kinetic typography, tasteful zooms.
- **Pitch.com teasers**: fast pacing, crash-zooms, monochrome-to-color transitions to emphasize state changes.
- **Notion Projects announcement**: calm VO paired with on-screen captions mirroring UI actions.
- **Figma Config Recap**: bold copy cards and rhythmic transitions for each feature beat.

## Structure & Title Beats (Text-Only, Motion Graphics)
1. **Hook Question (0–3 s)**  
   - Visual: flashes of messy dashboards, docs, and bots that smash-cut into your streamlined workspace spinning up automations.  
   - Text card: “Still wrangling data for days?” (animate in with glitch/scan lines, then snap out).  
   - Secondary text as you land in product: “Analyze & automate in minutes.”

2. **AI Constructs Table (3–12 s)** — *“Design”*  
   - Screen capture: open the AI prompt, describe the desired table (“Build a market analysis tracker with stage, TAM, MoM change…”), hit enter, watch columns appear automatically.  
   - Overlay banner: “Describe it. AI builds it.” (animate underline or sliding highlight)  
   - Motion cue: cursor highlight on the prompt submit, then rapid pop-ins on each newly generated column definition.

3. **Turn Columns into AI Research Mode (12–22 s)** — *“Co-pilot”*  
   - Open a column config, toggle the “AI Research”/prompted mode, paste a short instruction (“Summarize call sentiment, score 1–5”), hit save, and watch the icon switch to indicate automation.  
   - Overlay: “Flip any field into AI research.”  
   - Text tags appear near the column header (“Auto-summarize”, “Prompt-ready”) as the mode activates.

4. **AI Research Fills Data (22–32 s)** — *“Research”*  
   - Trigger the research action and capture rows auto-populating.  
   - Overlay: “Autofill insights.” (pulse animation synced to cells filling)

5. **File Workflow → Table (32–48 s)** — *“Automate”*  
   - Demo dragging varied files into the workflow pane, accepting suggested columns, and clicking Create.  
   - Overlay: “Import → structure → launch.” (stepper animation aligning with workflow UI)

6. **AI Copilot Everywhere (48–60 s)** — *“Always on”*  
   - Show the chat assisting with another tweak or summary, plus inline actions (e.g., quick column add or trend summary).  
   - Overlay: “AI everywhere.” (floating labels near chat responses)

7. **Outro (final beat)**  
   - Visual: workbook with table + doc + chart blocks; brand lockup.  
   - Text: “Analyze, research, automate—on one canvas.”  
   - CTA card: “Import. Research. Build. [product URL]” with animated underline sweep.

## Shot Checklist
1. Empty workbook → user adds columns (varied data types).  
2. AI chat adds a new column with a custom prompt.  
3. Research action filling rows.  
4. Column settings modal edit + manual cell update.  
5. Workflow footage: file upload, column suggestion review, table creation.  
6. Workbook view with multiple blocks (table, doc, chart) to confirm downstream value.  
7. Copilot chat performing another assist (e.g., “Summarize trends”).

Record each as its own clean take (1440p or 4K, cursor highlight on, demo data that isn’t resume-specific).

## Editing Notes (DaVinci Resolve)
- **Music & SFX**: energetic 115–125 BPM electronic track; add soft whooshes/clicks synced to UI interactions. Duck music by ~10 dB under VO.  
- **Transitions**: quick push-ins (5–7 %), match cuts on keystrokes, occasional whip pans between scenes.  
- **Text overlays**: 2–3 word verbs (“Design”, “Co-pilot”, etc.) using brand palette. Animate in/out on beats.  
- **Color & framing**: brighten whites, add subtle vignette, use blur/spotlight to isolate active UI zones.  
- **Outputs**: 16:9 master + 9:16 cut (swap text placement, maybe punch in tighter for mobile).

## Leveraging AI in Production
- Draft alternative hooks/CTAs with GPT for vertical-specific cuts.  
- Generate temporary VO via ElevenLabs/Play.ht for timing before final narration.  
- Ask AI for soundtrack recs (“60 s energetic techno @120 BPM”) to narrow searches.  
- Use image/video generators (Runway/Pika) for abstract intro/outro loops if needed.  
- Have AI condense/translate overlay text for localized versions.

## Next Steps
1. Approve script beats + overlays.  
2. Rehearse demo flows; record individual clips with clean data.  
3. Drop assets into Resolve, align with VO/temp VO.  
4. Iterate music + animation polish; export master + social cuts.
